## Diploma project: Defect detection of timber by methods of computer vision and machine learning
---
1. Computer vision methods represented by OpenCV: 
  * Hough Transform 
  * Canny detector 
  * Morphological transformations 
  * CLAHE and others
 *for basic defects forms/objects detection*
2. Machine learning for multi-label classification
  * AlexNet (pure TF): 97% accuracy
